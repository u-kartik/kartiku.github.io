I am a grad student working on materials science of low carbon foorprint steelmaking at [MPIE](https://www.mpie.de/2281/en).
    This is my personal website where I post my notes about things that I enjoy doing and having conversations about. [Materials Science](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/full/10.1021/acs.chemrev.2c00799) and its role in the fight against [Climate Change](https://www.un.org/en/climatechange/what-is-climate-change), [Badminton](https://youtu.be/rJoxacnxQZs?si=50DHI1ghCkBkJh_0), [Graphic Novels](https://www.reddit.com/r/graphicnovels/) and pop-culture in general.          

The webpage is under development right now, and thus has some random and unrelated things lying around. I plan to tidy it up once I have a bunch of posts ready to go. 


<!-- [Reverie](https://github.com/amitmerchant1990/reverie) is a Jekyll theme which is simple and opinionated. It's actually a fork of [jekyll-now](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now) with some additional features and personal touches which I've implemented to suit my needs for [my blog](https://www.amitmerchant.com).

This is a plug-and-play Jekyll theme which you can use on GitHub Pages without even setting up a local environment.
